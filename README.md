//Navigation
In lab10's navbar, I want people to know this page's content and they can choose which part they want to see first. Otherwise, they can just scan the page from top to bottom. The five buttons help with navigation.

//Overview
In the body part, I put some colorful bars to separate the header and the body. I want to give people an overview of the four seasons in Toronto, so I chose four beautiful pictures.

//Body
I want to use pictures + words to introduce the four seasons:

In Spring:
- I want to add four pictures: two on the left, two on the right
- Add some pretty emojis in the middle
- Give a headline with each picture

In Summer:
- I want to show two activities in Toronto

In Autumn:
- I want to change the layout
- Put different sizes of these two pictures

In Winter:
- I want to add two videos to show what Toronto looks like
- I tried to adjust the size of the videos, but it didn't look good
- Right now it looks a little bit empty

Also, at the bottom of each season section, I added a button to return to the home page.

//Contact
I added an email address and people can send text through the submit button (which hasn't been implemented yet)

//Footer
Added a logo and copyright information.

In this program, I try to write down the simple .css with bootstrap in a .html file, I think it's not convenient for a new coder.
I think the https://getbootstrap.com/ page is a good resource; I can get some new ideas from there.
